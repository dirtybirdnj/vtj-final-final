# 🧑‍🔬 About

Verticaltubejig.com was created by Mat Gilbert at the end of 2022 after two years of refinement and practice hunting the majestic Lake Trout in Lake Champlain.

The VTJ is not a new concept, Mat didn't invent it and if you have created youtube videos about this rigging please email me and I'll give credit.

The first few really successful ice fishing expeditions had success on rippin' rap style baits as well as small 1/4oz to 1/2oz jigheads.
