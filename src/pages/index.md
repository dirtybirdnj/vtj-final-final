We offer jigging lures designed to engage agressive fish that want to chase. If you are looking for slow flutter lures go elsewhere.

Our baits and trebles are all assembled (hand-painted and hand tied) in Huntington, Vermont. They represent an evolution of a few years of learning and fishing the waters of Lake Champlain. The process of experimenting with new colors, ideas and strategies will never end but we want to bring our findings to others and spread the word of the VTJ.
