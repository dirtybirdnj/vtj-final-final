Today we\'re going to explain how to create your own VTJ. This is the same process I went through, now I'm sharing my knowledge with you.

If you want to support VT2U and / or the VTJ project, the best way you can do this is to buy a lure from our store! If you can't afford that, the next best
thing you can do is to make your own DIY VTJ and dominate lake trout with it! Our goal is to help people catch more fish, and work to ensure that fish are
either released healthy or chosen for harvest at the appropriate size.

What you will need:

1. Eagle Claw Barrel Weights
2. VMC Split Rings
3. VMC Treble / Single Hooks
4. YUM! Tubes (Pearl white 3.5in)

First you want to add split rings to the top and bottom of the swivel, this will aid in sleeivng the tube over the weight.

Next you turn the tube upside down so all the tails are hanging out and away, if you are not careful you can get tube tails caught in the inside. It's not a huge deal but every bit of flash and action helps!

Snip a very small hole at the end of the tube, this will allow air to escape as you press the weight into the tube, and hopefully the split ring will pop out. You may need to mess with it a little bit but this is how it should look:

After you have the double split rings and the plastic tube on, now is a safer time to add the bottom hook. You can either do a treble hook or a single, I find that sometimes the single is easier to remove for fish which can
help with healthier and less bloody releases.
