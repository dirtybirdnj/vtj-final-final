What exactly IS a VTJ? It's a Vertical Tube Jig.

A VTJ is a barrel weight with a split ring and a treble or single hook attached to the bottom ring of the weight. You can either sleeve a plastic tube over the weight, or you can paint it colors. Our most effective color is pearl white. We find it's even more effective if you add a dressed treble or some rattling / vibrating elements.

A VTJ is a big heavy weight, and it's designed to dive FAST, or as fast as you need. We offer them in weights from 3/4oz up to 4oz, and you should adjust the size of bait you use to the activiy level of the fish you see.

This website talks about VTJs a lot, so it only made sense to create a page to describe what they are and how they work. This page covers the fundimentals and from here we will have more posts about how to rig your own and suggestions on how to pick the right one to maximize your potential to catch bigger fish.
