The new website is finally live!

The lures pictured above are all for sale on the shop page, you can send us a message on Facebook or Instagram if you want to buy one. They are all unique one-of-a-kind pieces so once they are gone they are GONE!

We will be making more on hopefully a bi-weekly basis, sign up for the newsletter and get the drop on new lures before somebody else snatches em&apos; up!



This website will continue to evolve and grow to help spread the gospel of the VTJ and help fisherman in both Lake Champlain and beyond target big agressive fish that chase.

We'll have more articles about how to handle the lakers, how to fully rig your own DIY VTJs and other tips and tricks for targeting our favorite gamefish.

Until next time, tight lines and low winds!
