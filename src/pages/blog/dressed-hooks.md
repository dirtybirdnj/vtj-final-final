excerpt: Unique, one-of-a-kind fishing hooks provide flash and color to enhance the presentation of your bait and obscure the hook.
---


Dressed hooks add flash, color and excitement to any bait. They also serve to obscure the hook from the fish, giving you that extra little edge against finnicky fish or just being a little less hesitent when they chase your bait.

In the beginning VTJs were only weights with soft plastics on them, but over time we realized that adding a little more flash to the end of the bait could either replace or enhance the tail of a traditional tube.

All of our hooks are tied with high quality name brands like VMC, Eagle Claw and Gamakatsu to name a few. We experiment with new and different shapes that others might be afraid to do. Give us a request and we'll do our best to bring your ideas to life.
