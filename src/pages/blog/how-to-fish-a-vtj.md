This article will detail a few of the strategies we've found that work best. If you have something to add please send us a note, we'd love to add your suggestions to the list!

First and foremost, you need to make sure you are VERTICAL. The V in VTJ is for vertical, and it's important to understand that wind, currents and boat / kayak drifting will affect your ability to see the lure on the fishfinder.

Second you need a fishfinder! Being able to see your lure is important, watching the activity and mood of the fish is the key to knowing when to reel up, how fast to reel and when to get ready to give em' the beans.

Here is, in no particular order 5 different strategies we reccomend for fishing the VTJ:

1. First Drop Magic
2. The Elevator Game
3. Dead sticking
4. Stirring up the bottom
5. Surprise chase
