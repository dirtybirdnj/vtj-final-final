excerpt: "One of the key features of the VTJ is the double swivel weight. It helps prevent fish from getting leverage and spitting the hook."

The VTJ is built with Eagle Claw barrel swivel weights. While others that don't have swivels will work, you may find you lose fish if they are able to get leverage on the lure.

The double swivels in the trolling weights we use offer not one but two points of swivel so the fish is never able to put torque leverage on the hook and spit it.

You can and will lose fish from time to time, so it's important to use appropriate tackle to help tilt the odds in your favor. Even if you aren't fishing a VTJ we reccomend putting a snap swivel on the end of your leader, we like how this makes it easier to switch out lures and also adds some extra swivel protection for those extra thrahsy fish!
