This 21g / 3/4oz Gold VTJ is great for situations where you don't have a lot of drift or you are blessed with spot lock! The smaller profile will attract big fish that are feeding on smaller bait, sometimes bigger ISNT'T better!

The gold immitates baitfish and depending on the body of water you are in, you might want to consider another color like high-vis green or red to compliment the more natural, metallic shine of this gold lure.

The dressed treble has black and gold material with a black thread on a dark VMC hook for maximum stealthiness and stickiness! Tip it with some baitfish meat, sleeve a tube over if you want and get ready for big agressive fish to crush!
